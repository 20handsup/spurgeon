### "I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians&hellip; &ndash;Romans 1:14

Paul was overwhelmed with the sense of his indebtedness to Jesus Christ, and he spent his life to express it.  The greatest inspiration in Paul's life was his view of Jesus Christ as his spiritual creditor  Do I feel that same sense of indebtedness to Christ regarding every unsaved soul?  As a saint, my life's spiritual honor and duty is to fulfill my debt to Christ in relation to these lost souls.  Every tiny bit of my life that has value I owe to the redemption of Jesus Christ.  Am I doing anything to enable Him to bringHis redemption into evident reality in the lives of others?  I will only be able to do this as the Spirit of God works into me this sense of indebtedness.

I am not a superior person among other people&mdash;I am a bondservant of the Lord Jesus.  Paul said, "&hellip;you are not your own&mdash;you were bought at a price&hellip;"

1 Corinthians 6:19-20.  Paul sold himself to Jesus Christ and he said, in effect, "I am a debtor to everyone on the face of the earth because of the gospel of Jesus; I am free only that I may be an absolute bondservant of Him." That is the characteristic of a Christian's life once this level of spiritual honor and duty becomes real  Quit praying about yourself and spend your lire for the sake of others as the bondservant of Jesus.  That is the true meaning of being broken bread and poured-out wine in real life.
