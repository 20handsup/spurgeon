<p><em>“If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.” — 1 Peter 2:3</em></p>
<hr>
  <p>If — then, this is not a matter to be take for granted concerning every one of the human race. “If:” — then there
    is a possibility and a probability that some may not have tasted that the Lord is gracious. “IF:” — then this is not
    a general but a special mercy; and it is needful to enquire whether we know the grace of God by inward experience.
    There is no spiritual favor which may not be a matter for heart-searching.
  </p>

  <p>But while this should be a matter of earnest and prayerful inquiry, no one ought to be content whilst there is any
    such thing as an “if” about his having tasted that the Lord is gracious. A jealous and holy distrust of self may give
    rise to the question even in the believer&rsquo;s heart, but the <em>continuance</em> of such a doubt would be an
    evil
    indeed. We must not rest without a desperate struggle to clasp the Savior in their arms of faith, and say, “I know
    whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him.” Do not rest,
    O believer, till thou hast a full assurance of thine interest in Jesus. Let nothing satisfy thee till, by the
    infallible witness of the Holy Spirit bearing witness with thy spirit, thou “perhaps” and peradventure” and “if” and
    “maybe” satisfy thy soul. Build on eternal verities, and verily build upon them. Get the sure mercies of David, and
    surely get them. Let thine anchor be cast into that which is within the veil, and see to it that thy soul be linked
    to the anchor by a cable that will not break. Advance beyond these dreary “ifs;” abide no more in the wilderness of
    doubts and fears; cross the Jordan of distrust and enter the Canaan of peace, where the Canaanite still lingers, but
    where the land ceases not to flow with milk and honey.
