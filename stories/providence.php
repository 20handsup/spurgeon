  <p>The Lord tries the righteous.” — Psalm 11:5</p>

  All events are under the control of Providence; consequently all the trials of
  our outward life are traceable at once to the great First Cause. Out of the
  golden gate of God’s ordinance the armies of trial march forth in array, clad
  in their iron armour, and armed with weapons of war. All providences are done
  to trial. Even our mercies, like roses, have their thorns. Men may be drowned
  in seas of prosperity as well as in rivers of affliction. Our mountains are
  not too high, and our valleys are not too low for temptations: trials lurk on
  all roads. Everywhere, above and beneath, we are beset and surrounded with
  dangers. Yet no shower falls unpermitted from the threatening cloud; every
  drop has its order ere it hastens to the earth. The trials which come from God
  are sent to prove and strengthen our graces, and so at once to illustrate the
  power of divine grace, to test the genuineness of our virtues, and to add to
  their energy Our Lord in His infinite wisdom and superabundant love, sets so
  high a value upon His people’s faith that He will not screen them from those
  trials by which faith is strengthened. You would never have possessed the
  precious faith which now supports you if the trial of your faith had not been
  like unto fire. You are a tree that has never would have rooted so well if the
  wind had not rocked you to and fro, and made you take firm hold upon the
  precious truths of the covenant grace. Worldly case is a great foe to faith;
  it loosens the joints of holy valour and snaps the sinews of sacred courage.
  The balloon never rises until the cords are cut; affliction doeth this sharp
  service for believing souls. While the wheat sleeps comfortably in the husk it
  is useless to man, it must be threshed out of its resting place before its
  value can be known. Thus it is well that Jehovah tries the righteous, for it
  causes them to grow rich towards God.
