<p>Paradoxes abound in Christian experience, and here is one — the spouse was
  asleep and yet she was awake. He only can
  read the believer’s riddle who has ploughed with the heifer of his experience.
  The two points in this evening’s text
  are — a mournful sleepiness and a hopeful wakefulness. <em>I sleep.</em>
  through sin that dwelleth in us we may become
  lax in holy duties, slothful in religious exercises, dull in spiritual joys,
  and altogether supine and careless. This
  is a shameful state for one in whom the quickening Spirit dwells; and it is
  dangerous to the highest degree. Even wise
  virgins sometimes slumber, but it is high time for all to shake off the bands
  of sloth. It is to the feared that
  <em>many</em> believers lose their strength as Samson lost his locks, while
  sleeping on the lap of carnal security.
  With a perishing world around us, to sleep is cruel; with eternity so near at
  hand, it is madness. Yet we are none of
  us so much awake as we should be; a few thunderclaps would do us all good, and
  it may be, unless we soon bestir
  ourselves, we shall have them in the form of war, our pestilence, or personal
  bereavements and losses. O that we may
  leave for ever the couch of fleshly ease, and go forth with flaming torches to
  meet the coming Bridegroom! <em>My
    heart waketh.</em> This is a happy sign. Life is not extinct, though sadly
  smothered. When our renewed heart
  struggles against our natural heaviness, we should be grateful to sovereign
  grace for keeping a little vitality within
  the body of this death. jesus will hear our hearts, will help our hearts, will
  visit our hearts; for the voice of the
  wakeful heart is really the voice of our Beloved, saying, “Open to me.” Holy
  zeal will surely unbar the door:

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh lovely attitude! He stands<br />
    With melting heart and laden hands;<br />
    My soul forsakes her every sin;<br />
    And lets the heavenly stranger in.”</p>
