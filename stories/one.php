<h1 class="center">Morning and Evening</h1>
<p>If we have been partakers with Jesus in His shame, we shall be sharers with Him in the lustre which shall surround
  Him when He appears again in glory. Art thou, beloved one, with Christ Jesus? Does a vital union knit thee to Him?
  Then thou art to-day with Him in His shame; thou hast taken up His cross, and gone with Him without the camp bearing
  His reproach; thou shalt doubtless be with Him when the cross is exchanged for the crown. But judge thyself this
  evening; for if thou are not with Him in the regeneration, neither shalt thou be with Him when He shall come in His
  glory. If thou start back from the black side of communion, thou shalt not understand its bright, its happy period,
  when the King shall come, and <em>all His holy angels with Him.</em> What! are <em>angels with Him?</em> And yet He
  took not up angels — Hee took up the seed of Abraham. Are the holy angels <em>with Him?</em> Come, my soul, if thou
  art indeed His own beloved, thou canst not be far from Him. If His friends and His neighbors are called together to
  see His glory, what thinkest thou if thou are married to Him? Shalt thou be distant? Though it be a day of judgment,
  yet thou canst not be far from that heart which, having admitted angels into intimacy, has admitted thee into union.
  Has He not said to thee, O my soul, “I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in
  lovingkindness”? Have not His own lips said it, “I am married unto thee, and My delight is in thee”? If the angels,
  who are but friends and neighbors, shall be with Him, it is abundantly certain that His own beloved Hephzibah, in whom
  is all His delight, shall be near to Him, and sit at His right hand. Here is a morning star of hope for thee, of such
  exceeding brilliance, that it may well light up the darkest and most desolate experience.</p>
