  This is love in the making. The love of God is not created—it is His nature.
  when we receive the life of Christ through the Holy Spirit, He unites us with
  God so that His love is demonstrated in us. The goal of the indwelling Holy
  Spirit is not just to unite us with God, but to do it in such a way that we
  will be one with the Father in exactly the same way Jesus was. And what kind
  of oneness did Jesus Christ have with the Father? He had such a oneness with
  the Father that He was obedient when His Father sent Him down here to be
  poured out for us. And He says to us, “As the Father has sent Me, I also send
  you” (John 20:21).

  Peter now realizes that he does love Him, due to the revelation that come with
  the Lord&apos;s piecing question. The Lord&apos;s next point is—“Pour yourself
  out. Don&apos;t testify about how much you love me and don&apos;t talk about
  the wonderful revelation you have had, just ‘Feed My sheep.&apos;” Jesus has
  some extra-ordinarily peculiar sheep: some that are unkempt and dirty, some
  that are awkward or pushy, and some that have gone astray! But it is
  impossible to exhaust God&apos;s love, and it is impossible to exhaust my love
  if it flows from the Spirit of God within me. The love of God pays no
  attention to my prejudices caused by my natural individuality. If I love my
  Lord, I have no business being guided by natural emotions—I have to feed His
  sheep. We will not be delivered or released from His commission to us. Beware
  of counterfeiting the love of God by following your own natural human
  emotions, sympathies, or understandings. That will only serve to revile and
  abuse the true love of God.
