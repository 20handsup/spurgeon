    <strong>He&hellip;wondered that there was no intercessor&ndash;Isaiah 59:16</strong>

  The reason many of us stop praying and become hard toward God is that we only
  have an emotional interest in prayer. It sounds good! to say that we pray, and
  we read hooks on prayer which tell us that prayer is beneficial—that our minds
  are quieted and our souls are uplifted when we pray. But Isaiah implied in
  this verse that God is amazed at such thoughts about prayer.

  Worship and intercession must go together; one is impossible without the
  other. Intercession means raising ourselves up to the point of getting the
  mind of Christ regarding the person for whom we are prayer (see Philippians
  2:5). Instead of worshiping God, we recite speeches to God about how prayer is
  supposed to work. Are we worshiping God or disputing Him when we say, “But
  God, I just don’t see how you are going to do this”? This is a sure sign that
  we are not worshiping. When we hose sight of God, we become hard and dogmatic.
  We throw our petitions at His throne and dictate to Him what we want Him to
  do. We don’t worship God, nor do we seek to conform God, we will become hard
  toward other people.

<p>
  Are we worshiping God in a way that will raise us up to where we can take hold
  of Him, having such intimate contact with Him that we know His mind about the
  ones for whom we pray? Are we living in a holy relationship with God, or have
  we become hard and dogmatic?

  Do you find yourself thinking that there is no one interceding properly? Then
  be that person yourself. Be a person who worships God and lives in a holy
  relationship with Him. Get involved in the real work of intercession,
  remembering that it truly is work&amp;mddash; work that demands all your
  energy, but work which has no hidden pitfalls. Preaching the gospel has its
  share of pitfalls, but intercessory prayer has none whatsoever.
