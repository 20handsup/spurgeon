<p><em>Strive with all diligence to keep out that monster unbelief.</em> It so
  dishonors Christ, that He will withdraw
  His visible presence if we insult Him by indulging it. It is true it is a
  week, the seed of which we can never
  entirely extract from the soil, but we must aim at its root with zeal and
  perseverance. Among hateful things it is the
  most to be abhorred. Its injurious nature is so venomous that he that
  exercises it and he upon whom it is exercised
  are both cut thereby. In thy case, O believer! it is most wicked, for the
  mercies of thy Lord in the past, increase
  thy guilt in doubting Him now. When thou dost distrust the Lord Jesus may
  well cry out, “Behold I am pressed under
  you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.” This crowning His head
  with thorns of the sharpest kind. It is
  very cruel for a well-beloved wife to mistrust a kind and faithful husband.
  The sin is needless, foolish, and
  unwarranted. Jesus has never given the slightest ground for suspicion, and it
  is hard to be doubted by those to whom
  our conduct is uniformly affectionate and true. Jesus is the Son of the
  Highest, and the unbounded wealth; it is
  shameful to doubt Omnipotence and distrust all-sufficiency. The cattle on a
  thousand hills will suffice for our most
  hungry feeding, and the granaries of heaven are not likely to be emptied by
  our eating. If Christ were only a cistern,
  we might soon exhaust His fulness, but who can drain a fountain? Myriads of
  spirits have drawn their supplies from
  Him, and not one of them has murmured at the scantiness of His resources.
  Away, then, with this lying traitor
  unbelief, for his only errand is to cut the bonds of communion and make us
  mourn an absent Savior. Bunyan tells us
  that unbelief has “as many lives as a cat:” if so, let us kill one life now,
  and continue the work till the whole nine
  are gone. Down with thee, thou traitor, my heart abhors thee.</p>
