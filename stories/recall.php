    “Thus says the LORD, ‘I remember…the kindness of your youth…’” (Jeremiah

<p>Am I as spontaneously kind to God as I used to be, or am I only
  expecting God to be kind to me? Does everything in my life fill His heart with
  gladness, or do I constantly complain because things don’t seem to be going my
  way? A person who has forgotten what God treasures will not be filled with
  yoy. It is wonderful to remember that Jesus Christ has needs which we can
  meet—“Give Me a drink” (John 4:7). How much kindness have I shown Him in the
  past week? Has my life been a good reflection on His reputation?
</p>
<p>God is saying to His people, “You are not in love with Me now, but I remember
  a time when you were.” He says, “I remember.. the love of your betrothal…”
  (Jeremiah 2:2). Am I as filled to overflowing with love for Jesus Christ as I
  was in the beginning, when I went out of my way to prove my devotion to HIm?
  Is that where I am now, or have I chosen man’s wisdom over true love for Him?
  Am I so in love with Him that I take no thought for where He might lead me? Or
  as I watching to see how much respect I get as I measure how much service I
  should give Him?
</p>
<p>As I recall what God remembers about me, I may also begin to realize that He
  is not what He used to be to me. When this happens, I should allow the shame
  and humiliation it creates in my life, because it will bring godly sorrow, and
  “godly sorrow produces repentance…” (2 Corinthians 7:10).
