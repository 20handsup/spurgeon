<p><em>“And I will remember My covenant.” — Genesis 9:15</em></p>

  Mark the form of the promise. God does not say, “And when ye shall look upon
  the bow, and ye shall remember My covenant, <em>then</em> I will not destroy
  the earth,” but it is gloriously put, not upon <em>our</em> memory, which is
  fickle and frail, but upon <em>God&rsquo;s</em> memory, which is infinite and
  immutable. “The bow shall be in the cloud; and <em>I</em> will look upon it,
  that <em>I may remember the everlasting covenant.”</em> Oh! it is not my
  remembering God, it is God&rsquo;s remembering <em>me</em>. Glory be to God!
  the
  whole of the bulwarks of salvation are secured by divine power, and even the
  minor towers, which we may imagine might have been left to man, are guarded by
  almighty, strength. Even the <em>remembrance</em> of the covenant is not left
  to our memories, for <em>we</em> might forget,, but our Lord cannot forget the
  saints whom He has graven on the palms of His hands. It is with us as with
  Israel in Egypt; the blood was upon the lintel and the two side-posts, but the
  Lord did not say,”When <em>you</em> see the blood will pass over you,” but the
  Lord did not say <em>I</em> see the blood I will pass over you.” My looking to
  Jesus brings me joy and peace, but it is God&rsquo;s looking to Jesus which
  secures
  my salvation and that of all His elect, since it is impossible for our God to
  look at Christ, our bleeding Surety, and then to be angry with us for sins
  already punished in Him. No, it is not left with <em>us</em> even to be saved
  by remembering the covenant. There is no linsey-wolsey here — not a single
  thread of the creature mars the fabric. It is not <em>of</em> man, neither
  <em>by</em> man, but of the Lord alone. We <em>should</em> remember the
  covenant, and we <em>shall</em> do it, through divine grace; but the hinge of
  our safety does not hang there — it is God&rsquo;s remembering us, not our
  remembering God.
