  <h3>“He answered him to never a word.” — Matthew 27:14</h3>

  He had never been slow of speech when He could bless the sons of men, but He
  would not say a single word for Himself. “Never man spake like this Man,” and
  never man was silent like Him. Was this singular silence
  <em>the index of His perfect self-sacrifice?</em> Did it show that He would
  not utter a word to stay the slaughter of His sacred person, which He had
  dedicated as an offering for us? Had He so entirely surrendered Himself that
  He should not interfere in His own behalf, even in the minutest degree, but be
  found and slain an unstruggling, uncomplaining victim? Was this silence a
  <em>type of the defenselessness of sin?</em> Nothing can be said in palliation
  or excuse of human guilt; and therefore, He who bore its whole weight stood
  speechless before His judge. Is not patient silence
  <em>the best reply to a gainsaying world?</em> Calm endurance answers some
  questions infinitely more conclusively than the loftiest eloquence. The best
  apologists for Christianity in the early days were its martyrs. The anvil
  breaks a host of hammers by quietly bearing their blows. did not the silent
  Lamb of God furnish us with <em>a ground example of wisdom?</em>
  Where every word was occasion for new blasphemy, it was the line of duty to
  afford no fuel for the flame os sin. The ambiguous and the false, the unworthy
  and mean, will ere long overthrow and confute themselves, and therefore the
  true can afford to be quiet, and finds silence to be its wisdom. Evidently our
  Lord, by His silence, furnished a
  <em>remarkable fulfillment of prophecy.</em> A long defense of Himself would
  have been contrary to Isaiah's prediction. “He is led as a lamb to the
  slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth Himself
  to be the true Lamb of God. As such we salute Him this morning. Be with us,
  Jesus, and in the silence of our heart, let us hear the voice of Thy love.
