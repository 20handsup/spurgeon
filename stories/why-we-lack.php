  As the disciples were commanded, you should also say nothing until the Son of
  Man has risen in you—until the life of the risen Christ so dominates you that
  you truly understand what He taught while here on earth. When you grow and
  develop the right condition inwardly, the words Jesus spoke become so clear
  that you are amazed you did not grasp them before. In face, you were not able
  to understand them before because you had not yet developed the proper
  spiritual condition to deal with them.

  Our Lord doesn&rsquo;t hide these things from us, but we are not prepared to receive
  them until we are in the right condition in our spiritual life, Jesus said, “I
  still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now” (John
  16:12). We must have a oneness with His risen life before we are prepared to
  bear any particular truth from Him. Do we really know anything about the
  indwelling of the risen life of Jesus? The evidence that we do is that His
  Word is becoming, understandable to us.

  “…tell no one…” But so many people do tell what they saw on the Mount of
  Transfiguration—their mountaintop experience. They have seen a vision and
  they testify to it, but there is no connection between what they say and how
  they live. Their lives don&rsquo;t add up because the son of Man has not yet risen
  in them. How long will it be before His resurrection life is formed and
  evident in you and in me?
